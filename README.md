# practice-vscodevim

In this project I have provided a series of exercises to practice vscode vim shortcuts to increase your productivity.
The files and folders have been systematically named so that they follow a sequence.
By the time you complete all the excercises, you should be an intermediate vim user.

Use the files in sample folder to practice and play around.
All the best!!
