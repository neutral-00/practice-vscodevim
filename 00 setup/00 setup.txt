## High precision vertical motions
- /{pattern} search forward inside a file
- ?{pattern} search backward inside a file
- after pressing enter press n to go to the next match and N to go to the prev match

## Move fatser with counts
- count{motion} allows to multiply the effects of the motion
- example 5j will move 5 lines down
- 10k will move 10 lines above
- gd jump to the defn fo what is under the cursor
- gf jump to a file in an import

## some more nifty core motions
- gg goto top of the file
- {line}gg to go specific line
- G to to end of file
- % jump to matching ({[]})

## editing like magic
- {operator}{count}{motion}
- operator is an action to perform like delete / change / yank etc
- count is the multiplier fo perform an action
- motion represents a piece of text to which to apply the action
- example
	- dj5 deletes 5 lines down
	- df' delete everything in the current line until the first occurence of ' (including the character)
	- dt' delete everthing in the current line until the first occurence of ' (excluding the character)
	- d/hello delete everything until the first occurence of hello
	- ggdG deletes a complete document

## other useful operators
- c aka change deletes and sends you to insertion mode
- y aka yank is to copy
- p aka put is to paste
- g~ to toggle caps
- double these operators to operate on a whole line
- dd changes a whole line
- dd deletes a whole line
- capitalize an operator to operate from the cursor to the end of line
- C changes from cursor location to the end of line
- D deletes from cursor location to the end of line

## useful settings
- set toggle line numbers
	- press esc and type :set number
	- press esc and type :set nonumber
	- press esc and type :set relativenumber
	- to unset relativenumber append ! to the above command as :set relativenumber!
