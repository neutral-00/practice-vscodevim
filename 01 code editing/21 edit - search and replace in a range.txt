## Search and replace in a range
:<range>s/search/replace

example:
[x] :s/old/new/g 		:	changes in 
[x] :18,19s/text/newtext		:	change text to newtext in the range 18 to 19 inclusive
[x] :.,$s/h2/h3/g		:	replace all h2 with h3 from current line with end
[x] :19s/h3/h4/g		:	replace all h3 in line 19 to h4

## special note
- if you want confirmation before replacing put c after /g
- if you know exactly the range and sure of what to replace you use :<range>s/old/new
